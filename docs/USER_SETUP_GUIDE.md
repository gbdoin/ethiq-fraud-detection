# Ethiq Fraud Detection - User Setup Guide

## Welcome to Ethiq

Ethiq protects you from phone scams by monitoring your calls in real-time. When we detect potential fraud, we alert your emergency contacts immediately. This guide will help you set up the service.

## How Ethiq Works

1. **You receive a call** on your regular phone number
2. **Your phone forwards the call** to your private Ethiq number
3. **Ethiq monitors the conversation** for scam indicators
4. **If fraud is detected**, your emergency contacts are alerted
5. **The caller still sees your real number** (not Ethiq's number)

## Quick Setup (15 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Your Account

1. Visit [app.ethiq.ai](https://app.ethiq.ai)
2. Click "Sign Up"
3. Enter your email and create a password
4. Verify your email address

### Step 2: Get Your Ethiq Phone Number

After signing in:
1. Go to "Settings" → "Phone Setup"
2. Click "Get My Ethiq Number"
3. Choose a number from the available options
4. Write down this number - you'll need it next

**Your Ethiq Number**: `___________________`

1. Go to "Emergency Contacts" in the app
2. Click "Add Contact"
3. Enter:
   - Name
   - Phone number (for SMS alerts)
   - Relationship (family, friend, caregiver)
4. Add at least 2 contacts for safety

### Step 5: Test Your Setup

1. Click "Test My Protection" in the app
2. We'll make a test call to your phone

## Troubleshooting

### Calls Not Being Forwarded

1. **Check forwarding is enabled** on your phone
2. **Verify the Ethiq number** is entered correctly
3. **Test with *#21#** (shows forwarding status on most phones)
4. **Contact support** if issues persist

### Not Receiving Alerts

1. **Check emergency contacts** have correct phone numbers
2. **Verify contacts can receive SMS** messages
3. **Check spam/blocked messages** on their phones
4. **Test alert system** from the app

### Caller ID Shows Wrong Number

This is normal - callers will see your real number, not Ethiq's number. This preserves caller verification (STIR/SHAKEN).

## Best Practices

### Do's ✅
- Keep at least 2 emergency contacts active
- Test the system monthly
- Update contact numbers if they change
- Report false positives to improve accuracy

### Don'ts ❌
- Don't disable forwarding without pausing protection
- Don't share your Ethiq number publicly
- Don't ignore alerts from the system
- Don't feel embarrassed if you get scammed - it happens

### Can scammers detect Ethiq?
No. The system is transparent to callers. They have no way to know you're protected.

### What if I'm traveling?
Ethiq works anywhere your phone has service. International calls may incur forwarding charges from your carrier.
